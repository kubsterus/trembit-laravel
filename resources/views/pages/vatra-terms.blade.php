			Service to
			You or any other party for any or no reason, including without limitation if You do not comply with these Terms
			or
			if we are investigating suspected misconduct. In short, you should not place any reliance on the Service being
			offered for any commercial or other purposes.

			communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute such content solely for the limited
			purpose
			of operating and enabling the Service to work as intended for You and for no other purposes. Make sure You have
			the
			necessary rights to grant us this license for any content that You submit to or through the Service.
		</div>

	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Representations, Warranties, and Disclaimers</h2>
		<div>
			You affirm that You are of legal age and are otherwise fully able and competent to enter into these Terms, and

		</div>
		<div>
			Vatra provides the Service using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care, and we hope that You enjoy
			using it. There are certain things that we do not promise about the Service.
		</div>
		<div>
			OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS, NEITHER TREMBIT NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY
			SPECIFIC PROMISES, WARRANTIES, OR COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE SERVICE. FOR EXAMPLE, VATRA DOES NOT MAKE ANY
			COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICE, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE SERVICE, OR THEIR RELIABILITY,
			AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE “AS IS”.
		</div>
		<div>
			SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
			PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Liability for the Service</h2>
		<div>
			WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, VATRA AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS,
			REVENUES, OR DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
		</div>
		<div>
			IN ALL CASES, VATRA, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT
			REASONABLY FORESEEABLE. THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATION SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER EITHER PARTY WAS ADVISED
			OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR THE FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY, AND ON A
			CUMULATIVE (RATHER THAN PER-INCIDENT) BASIS.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Business Uses of the Service</h2>
		<div>
			If You are a legal entity or business Using the Service or on whose behalf the Service is being Used (“Business
			User”), You will hold harmless and indemnify Vatra and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any
			claim, suit or action arising from or related to the Use of the Service or violation of these Terms, including
			any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’
			fees. The Business User is responsible for the activities of participants who Use the Service on behalf of or as
			a result of the Business User, and the Business User agrees to ensure that any and all such participants will
			comply with these Terms.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Waiver of Class Action</h2>
		<div>
			The parties expressly waive any right to bring any action, lawsuit, or proceeding (collectively, “Action”) as a
			class or collective action, private attorney general action, or any other proceeding in which any party acts or
			proposes to act in a representative capacity. No Action will be combined with another without the prior written
			consent of all parties to all affected Actions. If the class action waiver in this Section 11 is found to be
			illegal, invalid, or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then Section 11 will not apply solely
			with respect to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law separately.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Other (but Still Important)</h2>
		<div>
			We may modify, change, amend, replace or update these Terms or any additional terms that apply to the Service at
			any time and in any manner by updating the web page on which these Terms reside or otherwise notifying You. You
			should look at these Terms regularly. Any such modification, change, amendment, replacement or update shall be
			effective on the date of such update to the applicable web page (or on the date of such notification, where such
			notification is used by Vatra in lieu of such update), or on such later date specified by Trembit. If You do not
			agree to the modified terms for the Service, You should discontinue Your Use of the Service.
		</div>
		<div>
			These Terms do not create any third-party beneficiary rights.
		</div>
		<div>
			If You do not comply with these terms, and we do not take action right away, this does not mean that we are
			giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).
		</div>
		<div>
			If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.
