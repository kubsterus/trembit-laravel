                    Time and money saving
                    The use of telemedicine significantly saves time that can be spent on the road to the clinic and a long queue to the doctor. It also saves money, as an in-person visit to a doctor is usually more expensive than an online consultation.
                    Accessibility
                    The telemedicine application has no barriers and provides medical care to patients who live in regions remote from medical institutions."

                    What are Telemedicine Software Benefits for Doctors?
                    Flexibility
                    With the help of an interactive calendar, doctors can schedule calls to their patients by setting the start and end of the appointment, and consult patients from anywhere.
                    Workflow Improvement
                    Telemedicine app development solutions create an instant help or prioritization channel for each medical case, while improving patient-physician communication. Useful tools to collect, store, manage or use records simplify and streamline doctor&rsquo;s workflow.
                    Overhead reduction
                    Patient care through a healthcare app eliminates overhead costs for medical centers, significantly reducing the cost of dealing with patients in non-emergency cases or at home."
