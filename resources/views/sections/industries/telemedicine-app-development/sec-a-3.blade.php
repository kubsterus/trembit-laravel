                            <h3>Business Analysis</h3>
                            <p>Before embarking on telemedicine software development, it is critical to assess the industry/market in which the solution will be used. Conducting analysis at this stage will help determine the requirements of your potential users as well as your business goals. Therefore, after collecting the necessary data, we create a specification of business requirements. Our programming team then models the software requirements specification. This step searches for available APIs, SDKs, code libraries, and other components needed for telemedicine software development.</p>

                            <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                            <p>Since it is very important for our telemedicine app development company that your customers have the best experience using our application, the next step is to create its prototype. Through such a clickable application model, it will be possible to think over its functionality and understand how convenient it will be to use them. At the UX development stage, our designers think through the entire user journey from the app start page to the completion of targeted actions. In addition, the telemedicine software development UX team will be able to verify that the prototype can be implemented using the existing technology stack.</p>

                            <h3>UI Design Creation</h3>
                            <p>
                                After creating a prototype, our app design team starts working on the visual components, the purpose of which is to bring the design to a certain Style Guide. This stage of the project includes the development of all visual elements: color palette, fonts, transition animation from one screen to another and static images. The main task of developers at this stage is to make sure that a user-friendly ecosystem is created.

                            <h3>App Development</h3>
                            <p>Application feature programming is the most important part of the telemedicine software development process. At this stage, developers combine the results of the previous steps, create beta versions of the application, gradually bringing it to a release candidate. Project customers can follow the progress of development, and a personal project manager will keep them informed about the pace and results of each stage.</p>

                            <h3>Quality Testing</h3>
                            <p>App testing is carried out at every stage of telemedicine software development. But closer to the end, there is a large-scale quality check, during which developers program automated tests that check functions at the code execution level. The security properties of the telemedicine application are required to be tested, as it must be suitable for storing sensitive records and patient information. In addition, our testing team checks the application for responsiveness, and looks for typos and other bugs that can spoil the user experience.</p>

                            <h3>Product launch</h3>
                            <p>Finally, the final stage of a complex process: the release of a telemedicine application. Then you and your clients can benefit from your product. In addition, our telemedicine software development company offers long-term cooperation, which will allow us to update and improve your application in accordance with the latest technological requirements.</p>
