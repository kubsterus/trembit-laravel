                        <h2>Video Calling App Development Key Features</h2>
                        <p></p>
                        <div class="item-ap-k">

                            <h3>Video Calls &amp; Conferencing</h3>
                            <p>There are a lot of areas where the video call feature is extremely helpful: work meetings, distance learning, telemedicine, etc. During the video calling app development, advanced WebRTC technology is used. This guarantees the high quality of the sound and picture, as well as security. The number of participants is usually limited, so think about the maximum number of users before asking a video conferencing app development company to implement this feature.</p>

                            <h3>Voice Call &amp; Conference</h3>
                            <p>When the video is not required for communication, audio calls are a good option, especially when the sound quality is top- notch. WebRTC, which is used in video calling app development, guarantees the quality and security of the line, which can be used for a secret meeting or private conversation.</p>

                            <h3>Messaging</h3>
                            <p>Sometimes what cannot be said can be written and vice versa. The presence of the option to send both a group message and a personal one, during a video call or separately from it, expands the possibilities of communication.</p>

                            <h3>File sharing</h3>
                            <p>The ability to share files is essential for collaboration, and this is taken into account during video calling app development. This feature can be used both during a video or audio conference or independently. The tool supports the sharing of files of various formats, the quality of which is not affected when sent. The application provides a completely secure way to transfer, download, and store files.</p>

                            <h3>Screen sharing</h3>
                            <p>Screen sharing improves the efficiency of a business meeting and is often used during e-learning and webinars. Therefore, almost all conferencing software now has this feature in its virtual toolbox.</p>

                            <h3>Audio and Video Call Recording</h3>
                            <p>This feature is used to document the minutes of a meeting, keep a record of everything that happened during a meeting, or provide a recording to users who were unable to attend a live conference.</p>

                            <h3>Event planning</h3>
                            <p>With this feature, you can schedule an upcoming conference. To do this, you need to specify the start date and time, end date and time, specify the contact details of the presenter, and also enter a name for the event.</p>

                            <h3>End-to-End Encryption</h3>
                            <p>During video calling app development, the safety of using video conferencing software is a priority. Developers ensure that messages and files sent by users, as well as video and audio calls, will be protected from outsiders.</p>
