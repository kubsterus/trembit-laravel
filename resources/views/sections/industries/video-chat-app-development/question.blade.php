                    The basic technology stack looks like this:
                    Frontend: React + React Native, Angular, Redux, Swift, Kotlin, Java.
                    Backend: NodeJS, Postgres, Swift, Kotlin.
                    Devops: Jenkins, Docker, Kibana, Graphana, Traefik.
                    For advanced application development, we use advanced video application development technologies such as WebRTC and EasyRTC. For example, we implemented EasyRTC for our platforms Stusan for telemedicine group communications, and SIRIUS for musicians. We used WebRTC in the WebPRAX Face2Face platform for online therapy with a therapist."
