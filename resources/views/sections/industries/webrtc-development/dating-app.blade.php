                            <p>To protect the confidential information of users, we use end-to-end encryption when transmitting and storing data in the cloud.</p>

Change the camera and turn on the flashlight so that the doctor can better examine the parts of the body. Start a countdown so patients can see how much time is left until the end of the consultation. If one of the participants of the call is late, the second one can wait for the virtual waiting room.</p>
