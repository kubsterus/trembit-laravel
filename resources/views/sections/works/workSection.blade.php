                            <h3>Telemedicine</h3>
                            <p><b>Telemedicine</b> is online doctor visits via secure video connection.
                            </p>
                            <p>The COVID-19 situation enforced numbers of private clinics to review their way of treating their patients.
                                The telehealth platform we have created for them holds a wide range of features, which are specific for the Healthcare industry.
                                The top priority in such a project is data security, such as HIPAA, GDPR, or KBV compliance,
                                which we reach with the WebRTC technology and peer-to-peer connection. Features such as E-prescriptions, meeting calendar,
                                and whiteboards are the ones which differentiate telemedicine from the regular videoconferencing solutions.
                                Doctors can manage patients, meeting hours, along with the files, prescriptions, and notes,
                                attached to the specific patient and &ldquo;doctor visit meeting&rdquo;.

                                weekly activity. Our clients use our spreadsheet to update
                                10 opportunities in less than a minute. More time for selling.
                                Adoption is a no-brainer. Users are guided (not playbook-forced)
                                to ask the key questions about what the customer wants. </p>
