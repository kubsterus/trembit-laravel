To do this, you need to define your niche, purpose and audience.
                The second step is the issue of monetization, which may include: the creation of payment gateways and a personalized discount system, as well as setting up automatic recurring payments for a subscription.
                The last step before starting the development itself is to select a content source and define the functionality of the application.
                And finally, at the stage of developing an application that will satisfy all the functions, ideas and preferences you choose, an experienced programming team writes the code for each function. After connecting the application to the server, adjusting the configuration for optimal operation, and conducting tests during which possible errors are corrected, the product can be considered ready for use.
                The process of creating a streaming video app is quite laborious and requires technical knowledge and skills. Therefore, the qualified specialists from Trembit, which is a leading live streaming app development company, will be glad to assist you with this."

Since a video streaming application has many features and capabilities developed with an advanced selection of technologies and works seamlessly across multiple platforms, the cost of developing a fixed-numbers application is a challenge.
                The exact app development cost actually depends on several factors such as app size, number of features and functions integrated, design scalability, UI/UX design complexity level, etc.

                Connect your audio and video source(s) (such as a camera, computer screen, microphone, mixer, etc.) to the encoder. Then you need to configure the encoder. The most important parameters are resolution, frame rate, and bit rate. The next step is to configure the streaming destination settings (such as privacy, etc.). Then you need to tie your encoder and your streaming platform together. To do this, you copy and paste the URL and stream key from the CDN into the encoder. And the last step is to press the "Start Broadcast" button on the encoder to start your show.
