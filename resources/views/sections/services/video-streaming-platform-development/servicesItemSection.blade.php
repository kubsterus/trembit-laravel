                                Streaming is a technology that provides delivery of the content in real time. From small online
                                conferences to broadcast major events with a large number of connections.
                                <br>
                                Streaming video is content sent in compressed form over the Internet and displayed by the viewer
                                in real time. With streaming video or streaming media, an end- user does not have to wait to
                                download a file to play it. Instead, the media is sent in a continuous stream of data and is
                                played as it arrives. An end-user can use their media player to begin to play the data file before
                                the entire file has been transmitted.
                                <br>
                                It&rsquo;s a powerful way for media and entertainment companies to interact with their audience.
