                                Project salvation is a service of project recovery and updating your application.
                                It is a limited period of strong intervention taking drastic actions to save the project.
                                Our QA engineers will test your application and our developers team will fix it and clean it
                                from bugs. We will restore the &ldquo;lost&rdquo; or broken repositories of source code and much more.
                                Functional and performance testing is applied when it needed.
